## Reasons your mail in ballot could be rejected (taken from the [Notice of Rejected Ballot](https://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/forms/pol-sub/5-42f.pdf) that you would receive):
* Certificate on carrier envelope was not properly executed
* You failed to sign your signature or make your mark
* The witness failed to indicate on the envelope that you could not make a mark
* The assistant or witness failed to print their name
* The assistant or witness failed to sign their name
* The residence address of the assistant or witness was not given
* It was determined that the signature on the application for ballot by mail and carrier envelope was not signed by the same person
* Application for ballot by mail did not state a legal ground for voting by mail
* Voter registration records indicated you did not have an effective registration for this election
* Address to which ballot was mailed was not outside the county. Voting early by mail due to expected absence from the county requires balloting materials be mailed to an address outside the county. 
* The residence address on the statement of residence is not located in the political subdivision conducting the election
* The mailing address on the application for ballot by mail did not match your voter registration address nor did the mailing address match any addresses provided on your statement of residence. Since you did not indicate on your application for a ballot by mail that you were having your ballot mailed to a hospital, retirement center, long term care facility, nursing home, jail, or a relative, your ballot was rejected. 
* The statement of residence was not included in the carrier envelope
* No identification was included with your mail ballot
* Other:_____
