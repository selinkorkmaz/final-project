## What are alternatives to in-person voting? 
The State of Texas at the moment has not implemented specific or expanded methods of voting in response to the global pandemic. Instead, here are two safety-conscious options for elibgible voters. 
<br/>
1. **`Mail-in Voting`**: If you have a disability, are over the age of 65, will be out of the county for early voting and election day, or are confined in jail (but otherwise eligible), you can apply to vote by mail. An election clerk _cannot_ question you about your qualifications to vote. Learn how to apply [here](https://www.sos.texas.gov/elections/voter/reqabbm.shtml).
2. **`Curbside Voting`**: If you are physically unable to enter the polling place or have symptons of COVID-19, you can request for a ballot to be brought to your car at the curb. An election clerk _cannot_ question you about your physical inability to enter a polling place. You do not have to apply for benefit; simply call your polling place.
