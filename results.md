### Did Trump win 304 or 306 electoral votes? 
Trump won states (and one district in Maine) worth 306 electoral votes (this map). However, two Texas electors did not cast their actual ballots for him, so history will record Trump as winning 304 electoral votes. The [2016 historical interactive map](https://www.270towin.com/2016_Election/interactive_map) shows the 'official' electoral vote, which Trump won 304-227, with seven total faithless electors.
